project_name: Smart Expense Classifier

description: >
  iOS SwiftUI app that sends expense text to a FastAPI backend for NLP-based classification.
  The ML model predicts categories (Food, Travel, Shopping, etc.), and the frontend visualizes
  expenses using Swift Charts.

languages:
  - Swift
  - Python

frontend:
  path: ios/SmartExpenseClassifier/
  framework: SwiftUI
  architecture: MVC
  mvc:
    models: Data types (Expense, Category) + decoding
    views: SwiftUI Views + Charts (render-only)
    controllers: Coordinators/Controllers for state + navigation + API calls
  api_integration: URLSession calling FastAPI endpoints
  testing: Simulator only (no camera/mic dependencies)
  notes:
    - Controllers own business/state; Views stay declarative and dumb
    - Use async/await in controllers for networking
    - Avoid third-party Swift packages unless necessary

backend:
  path: backend/
  framework: FastAPI
  architecture: MVC-ish (routers=controllers, schemas=models, services=business logic)
  layers:
    models: Pydantic schemas (request/response)
    controllers: FastAPI routers/endpoints
    services: classification logic, stats aggregation
  ml_library: scikit-learn
  model_file: model/expense_classifier.pkl  # planned; start in-memory
  routes:
    - GET /health
    - POST /classify
    - POST /expenses
    - GET /expenses
    - GET /stats/category
  hosting: Render or Railway
  notes:
    - Preload model on startup (later: load from joblib file)
    - Enable CORS for iOS simulator and device

version_control:
  - Commit small, functional units (frontend/backend separately)
  - Use branches: feature/frontend, feature/backend, main

documentation:
  - Maintain README.md at root with:
      * architecture diagram (MVC)
      * tech stack summary
      * run instructions (backend + iOS simulator)
